# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** [Milo Ruffing]  
**Date:** [10/26/2025]

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- [How to set up a repository, and commit changes to the repository. I also learned how to parse through hallucinating AI instructions that repeat the same points over and over.]

## Challenges and Solutions
[The biggest challenge in this workflow was following the instructions. Since the entire assignment was generated by AI, it was thorough, but only on the surface level, and it didn't follow any logical order, and looped back on itself, repeating instructions several times. It took some effort to figure out exactly what I was supposed to do. ]

## Connection to My GIS Career
[Github is a common tool used in workplaces, so should I get a job at a workplace that uses github, I will have a much stronger foundation with which to build upon, and I will understand the training videos that they will inevitably assign to me a little bit more thoroughly.]

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
